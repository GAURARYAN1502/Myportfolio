                <p>This mini project is for my third year, focusing on frontend technology such as html, css, and js. The purpose of this website is to offer high-quality books at a discounted price to the public. Instead of being limited to a small selection of books and minimal discounts at physical stores, people can easily browse and purchase any book at a better price through this platform.
